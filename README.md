# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## React Router
The react-router-dom package is in use in theis project.
The BrowserRouter is first imported in the index.js and then used to wrap the <App /> component.

The Route component is used to specify which component to render based on the URL that matches the path.
It takes two props:
    path: the path to match
    element: the component to render if the path is mathed

The Routes component helps render a single route exclusively by wrapping multiple Route components within it.
    If no match is found, a default NotFound component can be rendered.

Link --> a react router component that allows navigation between pages/vews without reloading/refereshing the application

The Outlet component from React Router allows to map child components inside of a Route component. Useful, for example, for a Navbar placement inside an app.

The Route component allows for definition of dynamic segments that can be extracted from the URL and be used in the application (dynamic routing).

Route Guards in the context of React Router refers to a mechanism that allows the control of access to routes based on specific set rules or conditions.

They are used to protect certain routed and ensure users meet certain criterion before they are able to access them.

## Using animations in React Router for a better user experience
You can use:
    [] React transition group --> easy to use and uses pure CSS for animations.
    [] Framer motion
